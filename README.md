# band_name_generator_in_python
# Project Overview
This project is a simple Python-based Band Name Generator that creates a fun and creative band name based on user input. The program asks the user for the name of the city they grew up in and their pet’s name. Once both inputs are provided, the program combines them to generate a unique band name suggestion. This project demonstrates basic Python programming concepts, user interaction, and string formatting.

# What Is Happening in This Project?
The program prompts the user to enter:
  * The name of a city
  * The name of a pet
All user inputs are stored in variables. The program uses string formatting to combine the inputs into a single sentence. The generated band name is then printed to the console. Each time the program runs, the output changes depending on what the user enters.

# Theories & Concepts Used
  * User Input (input())
  * Variables
  * String Formatting (f-strings)
  * Sequential Program Flow

# Run the Program
(If you don’t have Python installed, download and install Python first)
